Car game using experimental car engine sound

Wanted to test how cinematic and iconic TXH Deep Note would work as a car engine sound.
So first had to create simple car game where I could implement audio..
Used Udemy's Unity 2D course's Delivery Driver as a guide and added more drifting controller to make driving more fun.
